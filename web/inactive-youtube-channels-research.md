# Inactive YouTube Channels with Good Narration Voices
## Research for Chatterbox TTS Voice Cloning References
### Date: February 9, 2026

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This research was conducted via web search, Social Blade, Wikitubia, and various YouTube analytics platforms. Due to the nature of web search, **exact verification of last upload dates and current subscriber counts is limited for smaller channels**. The channels below represent the best-verified candidates found through extensive research. **You should manually verify each channel's current status on YouTube** before using any voice samples.

The hardest part of this task is that truly small (under 50K) inactive channels with good production quality are, by definition, obscure and poorly documented online. Most search results surface active or large channels.

## VOICE CHARACTERISTICS GUIDE FOR CHATTERBOX TTS

When selecting the final voice reference samples, prioritize:

1. **10-15 seconds of clean speech** - No music, no other speakers, no sound effects
2. **Natural conversational tone** - Not overly performed or theatrical
3. **Consistent room tone** - Same recording environment throughout the clip
4. **Varied phonemes** - The clip should include a range of vowel and consonant sounds
5. **Mid-sentence clips work best** - Avoid starts/ends of sentences where pitch changes unnaturally
6. **48kHz/16bit minimum** - Most YouTube audio at 720p+ will meet this requirement
